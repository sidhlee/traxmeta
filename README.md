# TraxMeta

A jQuery app that displays Spotify Global Top200 chart and shows meta information about the track user selected.

> Note: Because all API requests are made against netlify lambda functions with different origin, you would sometimes get CORS error on initial page load on local server. Try refreshing the page after few minutes to resolve this problem.
